# OptiSentry
The proposed idea was to create a turret with real-time tracking for complete automation. It employs OpenCV for real-time target tracking, controlled by an Arduino Uno. It harnesses and integrates computer vision with embedded systems to control a Defense turret which tracks humans and shoots when the target is in range. The turret supports movements in polar configuration and can shoot the weapon mounted on it via a simple trigger mechanism.
